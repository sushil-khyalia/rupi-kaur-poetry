you must remember it too
how the rest of the city slept
while we sat awakened for the first time
we hadnâ€™t touched yet
but we managed to travel in and out
of each other with our words
our limbs dizzying with enough electricity
to form half a sun
we drank nothing that night
but i was intoxicated
i went home and thought
are we soul mates
