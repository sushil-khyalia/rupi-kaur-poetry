somewhere along the way
i lost the self-love
and became my greatest enemy
i thought i’d seen the devil before
in the uncles who touched us as children
the mobs that burned our city to the ground
but i’d never seen someone as hungry
for my flesh as i was
i peeled my skin off just to feel awake
wore it inside out
sprinkled it with salt to punish myself
turmoil clotted my nerves
my blood curdled
i even tried to bury myself alive
but the dirt recoiled
you have already rotted it said
there is nothing left for me to do

- self-hate
