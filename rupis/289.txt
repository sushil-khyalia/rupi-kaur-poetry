advice i would’ve given
my mother on her wedding day

1. you are allowed to say no

2. years ago his father beat the language of love
out of your husband’s back
he will never know how to say it
but his actions prove he loves you

3. go with him
when he enters your body and goes to that place
sex is not dirty

4. no matter how many times his family brings it up
do not have the abortion just because i’m a girl
lock the relatives out and swallow the key
he will not hate you

5. take your journals and paintings
across the ocean when you leave
these will remind you who you are
when you get lost amid new cities
they will also remind your children
you had an entire life before them

6. when your husbands are off
working at the factories
make friends with all the other
lonely women in the apartment complex
this loneliness will cut a person in half
you will need each other to stay alive

7. your husband and children will take from your plate
we will emotionally and mentally starve you
all of it is wrong
don’t let us convince you that
sacrificing yourself is
how you must show love

8. when your mother dies
fly back for the funeral
money comes and goes
a mother is once in a lifetime

9. you are allowed to spend
a couple dollars on a coffee
i know there was a time when
we could not afford it
but we are okay now. breathe.

10. you can’t speak english fluently
or operate a computer or cell phone
we did that to you. it is not your fault.
you are not any less than the
other mothers with their
flashy phones and designer clothing
we confined you to the four walls of this home
and worked you to the bone
you have not been your own property for decades

11. there was no rule book for how
to be the first woman in your lineage
to raise a family on a strange land by yourself

12. you are the person i look up to most

13. when i am about to shatter
i think of your strength
and harden

14. i think you are a magician

15. i want to fill the rest of your life with ease

16. you are the hero of heroes
the god of gods
